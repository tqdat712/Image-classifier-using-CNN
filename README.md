# Image classifier using CNN
Accquired data from Kaggle
Conducted data preprocessing and data augmentation with OpenCV, imageop and imgaug.
Performed weighted random sampler for imbalanced data.
Implemented multiple CNN training models with different architectures and activation functions with Pytorch.
Graphically represented their performance with matplotlib and sklearn.

/This project was under the curriculum of course CMPUT 466 at the University of Alberta./
